# vr-nyxics
VR Interaction/Physics Stuffs for experiences!

As of currently writing this, the repostitory is empty! I intend to develop this project on the side of some other higher priority tasks I have, and decided to let the repository be public from the start to try out developing in the open for once rather than keeping everything private constantly.

## This project may go literally no where. But feel free to keep track of it, I suppose!
